# covid-19-response-analysis

This project idea originally came from a competition held by S&P Global aiming to get the enterprises’ responses to COVID-19, to differentiate those responses across different dimensions and to categorize the S&P 500 firms by those dimensions. Our team focused on the following two aspects of the competition idea and tried deepening its business impacts and applications.

## A reflection of public firms’ responses in era of COVID-19 during late 2019 to early 2021

With the outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, the heightened economic uncertainty and risk have significant financial implications on companies in difference sectors. Many firms have thus taken actions including closing out offices, laying off employees, giving public donations etc. By collecting and analyzing the S&P 500 firms’ public release materials, this project aims to find out the differences between those actions by action types and action speed, further categorizing the public firms by these two dimensions. 

## An interpretation of the categorization by public firms’ commercial characteristics

It’s usually not a coincidence for a firm to take certain actions. With the rapid spread of the COVID-19 in both US and other parts of the whole world, public firms’ response actions and reaction swiftness will be affected by various aspects including company culture, company industry, risk appetite and financial robustness. While coming up with those categorizations, the team also tried to interpret them and find out the commonalities within one classification, thinking behind those actions for specific firms, how they intend to deliver messages, maximize the return of shareholders and reflect their sense of corporate social responsibility.
